@article{Velut.2024,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of poor prognosis. Although immune checkpoint blockers have shown promising results in advanced SCLC, the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) remains poorly understood, with no validated prognostic or predictive biomarkers of efficacy.

METHODS

This retrospective study included surgically samples from 48 SCLC patients between 2009 and 2018. We assessed the TME using two quantitative 7-plex immunofluorescence panels focusing on T and B cells, and compared it to NSCLC (N~=~10). Molecular subtypes were determined by assessing the expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1 and YAP1 using immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS

Immune-hot SCLC were defined as those exhibiting the highest immune cell and immune-related marker densities. They were associated with longer overall survival, significantly more frequently detected at early stages, and exhibited high PD-L1 expression in immune cells, but were not associated with molecular subtypes. Compared to NSCLC, SCLC had significantly lower densities of CD20~+~cells and higher density of PD1~+~cells, with no significant differences in CD4~+~, CD8~+~and plasma cell densities. In univariate analysis, the highest OS was significantly associated with early stage (p~{\textless}~0.001), low expression of NEUROD1 (p~=~0.047), high PD1~+~cell density (p~{\textless}~0.001) and high PD-L1 immune cell expression (p~=~0.04). Only stage and PD1~+~cell density emerged as independent prognostic markers.

CONCLUSION

SCLC TME is highly heterogeneous. Immune-hot tumors were associated with OS but not with molecular classification. PD1 expression and PD-L1 expression by immune cells may thus serve as a prognostic marker.},

@article{Gay.2021,
 abstract = {Despite molecular and clinical heterogeneity, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is treated as a single entity with predictably poor results. Using tumor expression data and non-negative matrix factorization, we identify four SCLC subtypes defined largely by differential expression of transcription factors ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 or low expression of all three transcription factor signatures accompanied by an Inflamed gene signature (SCLC-A, N, P, and I, respectively). SCLC-I experiences the greatest benefit from the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy, while the other subtypes each have distinct vulnerabilities, including to inhibitors of PARP, Aurora kinases, or BCL-2. Cisplatin treatment of SCLC-A patient-derived xenografts induces intratumoral shifts toward SCLC-I, supporting subtype switching as a mechanism of acquired platinum resistance. We propose that matching baseline tumor subtype to therapy, as well as manipulating subtype switching on therapy, may enhance depth and duration of response for SCLC patients.},
