He is a bioinformatician and AI specialist focused on learning the cutting-edge technologies available in the industry and a true believer in life-long learning. I had the pleasure of working with him in developing an MVP for a product that can change the way we do bioinformatics, and I must say that he always makes time in his heavy PhD schedule to work and improve his skills never giving up on presenting results in some of the most organized ways I've ever seen. I think anyone would find Rafael a great addition in their team, wherever it's a biomedical team or a more IT-focused solutions company."
